Understanding vs. Rushing to Complete
In the context of learning and mastery, making sure you fully understand the work is far more important than rushing to complete as many cards as possible. 

Understanding the material deeply enhances retention and application in real-world scenarios. Rushing might give a false sense of accomplishment but often leads to superficial knowledge.

Engaging with the content fosters critical thinking skills, enabling problem-solving abilities that are essential in any field.

Investing time to comprehend the subject increases the likelihood of recalling information later and using it effectively, which is far more valuable than merely checking boxes.

Quality Over Quantity: It is more beneficial to thoroughly understand fewer concepts than to have a shallow grasp of many. The quality of learning has a lasting impact.

In conclusion, prioritizing understanding over the quantity completed leads to a stronger foundation and more meaningful learning experience.
