I grew up in a close-knit family in a vibrant township just outside Durban. My parents, both teachers, instilled in me the values of education and hard work from a young age. My childhood was characterised by a strong community spirit and an enduring fascination with technology; I often tinkered with old computers and gaming consoles, trying to understand how they worked.I attended a local public school, where he excelled in mathematics and science. I pursued a degree in Computer Science at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where I discovered his passion for web development during a coding boot-camp offered as part of my curriculum. I am an optimistic and determined individual. I have a curious mind, always eager to learn new technologies and skills. My friends describe me as a reliable and supportive person who often goes out of my way to help others. I have a great sense of humour, which I use to lighten the mood during stressful programming sessions. Despite facing financial challenges, I remains positive and motivated to succeed.

I aspires to become a web developer specialising in creating innovative and user-friendly websites for local businesses in his community. I dreams of establishing a tech startup that focuses on providing affordable web solutions for small businesses, helping them to create an online presence and leverage digital tools for growth. I believes strongly in the power of technology to uplift communities and create opportunities. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing soccer and is an avid fan of Marvel superhero movies. I am also passionate about community service and often volunteers his time to teach coding workshops for local youth, aiming to inspire the next generation of tech enthusiasts. I am working on a personal website to showcase my portfolio, which includes several small projects I have completed for  university courses and local non-profits. I am also participating in hackathons to sharpen his skills and network with other developers. 

My aim is to secure an internship with a tech company after graduating. My plans to continue his education through online courses and certifications while working as a freelance web developer. Ultimately, my goal is to create a digital hub for my community, where young people can learn and innovate, just as I did. In essence, I embody the spirit of ambition and community-driven purpose, exploring the world of web development not just for personal gain but to uplift those around me.
